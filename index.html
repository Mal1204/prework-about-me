      <h1>Introduction</h1>
      <p>Hi, I'm Malcolm. If its one thing I love to do, it is to learn. Right now I'm learning coding and this is my first web page.</p>
      <h1>Where I'm From</h1>
      <p>I am currently in Sunny Qld Australia. It is the land blessed with beaches, sunny skies and beatiful landscapes. </p>
      <h1>What are your favorite hobbies?</h1>
      <p>If I could point to one hobby, it would be music. I also love to work on cars and motorbikes and I love exploring places.</p>
      <h1>What's your dream job?</h1>
      <p>The dream job would use my skills and knowledge to the max. It would feel rewarding and I would wake up everyday wanting to do better than yesterday.</p>
      <h1>Where do you live?</h1>
      <p>Halfway between Brissy and GoldCoast</p>
      <h1>Why do you want to be a web developer?</h1>
      <p> As the years have gone by. I found myself exploring more business areas of work. Currently I work for a firm that is involved with NDIS invoicing. A lot of tasks are repititive and could be automated with programming. I believe that programming can help with generating customized reports and files that communicate with the NDIS portal, accounting software and any CMS used by the orgnanization. Who knows, I might actually come up with the CMS that actually aligns with business needs from an accounting and user perspective.</p>
